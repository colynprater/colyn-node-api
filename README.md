# colyn-node-api

An API that returns a JSON response body when make a get request to the path: `/hello`

## Getting started

Simple have node installed (preferably `8.12.0`), clone this repository and start the API server with

```
node index.js
```

## Paths

The API is currently hardcoded to run on `port 3000`, once the server is running the domain can be reached at `lvh.me:3000` or `localhost:3000`. The only working path is `/hello`, so to get a response you will need to hit eg: `http://localhost:3000/hello`.
